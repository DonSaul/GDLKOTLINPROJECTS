# Hello, I'm Eduardo and these are my projects 🖥️!

Here I'll be sharing my progress, assignments and coding activities related to the Kotlin Project Lab 🤖🚀

## Current projects

- `Tasks3 - Note-taking` . This a simple note-taking app, that allows the user to create and visualize notes writing by it as self reminders. It has simple text validation for empty inputs and character limit, as well as a splash screen displaying a Lottie Animation, and it shows the note details inside a Dialog by clicking on each card.
